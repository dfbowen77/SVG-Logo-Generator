# SVG-Logo-Generator
This repo represents my submission for the module 10 challenge to make a SVG logo generator. 

## Description
The following program is designed to meet the requirements of the Module 10 Challenge. It represents the beginnings of a SVG Logo Generator. Users input from 1 to 3 characters that represent the text on their logo. They then select either a circle, square, or triangle for the logo's shape. Finally, they select both a color for the shape and a color for the logo's text. The logo gets automatically generated and saved to the user's computer.
